### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In JavaScript the order of the code makes a difference in if the function will work correctly. For example, the total amount had to be placed before the other percentage calculations for all of them to calculate properly.
2. JavaScript code goes between the script elements in an HTML document.
3. JavaScript is a loosely typed programming language, which means that you do not declare the datatypes of variables explicitly.
